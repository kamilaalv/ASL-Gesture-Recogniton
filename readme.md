# SignifyPlus Baseline - ASL Gesture Recognition

> Breaking down communication barriers through real-time American Sign Language translation

**SignifyPlus** is an AI-powered system that translates American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text in real-time. This project addresses the critical communication gap between deaf and hearing communities by providing instant, accurate gesture recognition using computer vision and deep learning.

## The Problem

Over 70 million deaf people worldwide use sign language as their primary communication method, yet most hearing individuals cannot understand sign language. This creates significant barriers in:
- Healthcare settings
- Educational environments  
- Professional interactions
- Emergency situations
- Daily social interactions

## Our Solution

SignifyPlus uses advanced computer vision and neural networks to:
- **Real-time recognition**: Translate ASL gestures as they happen
- **High accuracy**: 52% mean average precision on gesture classification
- **Accessible technology**: Works with standard webcams and mobile devices
- **Scalable system**: Supports expanding vocabulary of signs

## How It Works

1. **Hand Detection**: MediaPipe extracts 21 3D hand landmarks from video feed
2. **Feature Engineering**: Converts landmark coordinates into meaningful geometric features
3. **Sequence Processing**: LSTM neural network captures temporal dynamics of gestures
4. **Real-time Prediction**: Outputs recognized signs with confidence scores
